* To install, add the lib folder to your Matlab path, e.g.:
>> addpath('C:/path/to/folder/lib');

* On Windows, if you are missing MSCVC Runtime libraries, also add the dll folder to your Matlab path, e.g., on Win64:
>> addpath('C:/path/to/folder/lib/dll_w64');

* You should now be ready to create your first ZozaniDB object. For examples and documentation, visit  http://zozani.com/zozanidb
